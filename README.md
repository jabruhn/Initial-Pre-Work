# TG-Pre-Work

### While we do want our developers to work smarter, not harder, please refrain from plagiarizing.  It is completely fine to reword information you have gleaned from internet sources, however, please be prepared to redo the work should you submit a directly copied/pasted answer.  If you must copy/paste, cite your sources (this citation doesn't need to be fancy - just state directly where you found the information or provide a link).  Additionally, some of the questions below are tricky.  The answers were not necessarily covered in the reading we assigned.  They are not intended to be straightforward because we expect you to do some research to discover the answers to the best of your ability.  If you cannot find an answer, explain what you do know and what you are stuck on.  

## When we hit https://www.techtonic.com/ what happens? Don’t focus too much on architecture (Monolithic, SOA, Microservices, etc.). Try to focus more on how the web functions in general terms/steps.

An address or location is typed into the browser. The location is the server that is being requested. The page that is viewed allows for direction to different pages of information and/or locations for concise information, which may include data, applications or storage capability.

## From start to finish, how does data reach you to be rendered in the browser?

after requesting specific information to the server, the server then generates the specific information that is readable to the browser by way of code.

## What code is rendered in the browser?

html, css and javascript

## What is the server-side code’s main function?

provide requested information to client and maintain server integrity (e.g security, encryption, licensing and reliability)
## What is the client-side code’s main function?

promote usability and functionality

## What is runtime?

Runtime is when a program is running ( or being executable). In some programming languages certain reusable programs or "routines" are built and packaged as a runtime library.

## How many instances of the client-side assets (HTML, CSS, JS, Images, etc.) are created?

As long as their is access to the internet, client side assets are created continuously (e.g. new functions, data storage, and security).

## How many instances of the server-side code are available at any given time?

I did not research this, but I would say one at a time per client. Many clients however can access different code depending on tree outcome and server capacity.

## How many instances of the databases connected to the server application are created?

It depends on server side coding and its complexity. Again not researched.
